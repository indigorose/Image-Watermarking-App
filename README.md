# Image Watermarking App
 
An image watermarking app using the tkinter interface and Pillow, a fork of the Python Interface Library (aka PIL) 
within Python to add a text watermark to an image.

## Getting Started
 
Please clone the repository and run the `main.py` from the terminal to begin.

Load images from the source code on line 7, for the ease of initial use, there are two picture files `beach.png` and `forest.py` to try.
 
Other files from your own directory can also be used as further examples.
 
Please add your text in the watermark text box then use the “add watermark” button to add your chosen text to the image and save it to your chosen destination on line 12.

"Show Image" on the app will display the final product. 
 
## Pending Improvements
 
I hope to make further amendments in the form of the ability to add files from any directory as well as the function to add logos.
 
I will also be looking into adding further options on the app such as colour and picture size changes. 
 
### Thoughts
 
Again, this was an interesting app to create as it required the use of Pillow which I am unfamiliar with. However, I saw this as an opportunity to strengthen my documentation reading skills. I would also like to acknowledge Codemy.com and John Elder on YouTube as they provided a good breakdown of the watermarking functionality of Pillow.
